# Orbits Simulation

Welcome to the Orbits Simulation repository. This Python-based project is designed to simulate the orbital dynamics of planets around the Sun. It provides an interactive platform to explore the fundamental principles of celestial mechanics through computational methods. Whether you're a student, educator, or researcher, this repository offers valuable tools to simulate and analyze the behavior of planetary orbits under various conditions.

## Features

- **Accurate Planetary Models**: Simulate the orbits of planets using real-world data and physics-based models.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Modify initial conditions and physical parameters to explore different orbital scenarios.
- **Visualization Tools**: Generate visual representations of planetary orbits and their dynamics over time.

## Getting Started

To get started with these simulations:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/azimonti/orbits-simulation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```
   cd orbits-simulation
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the simulation scripts:
   ```
   python solar_system.py
   ```
## 2 years simulation

A simulation for 2 years starting from 1st January 2024 looks as follows.

## Yukawa Potential

Yukawa potential (a potential which has an exponential decay in addition to the standard Newtonian gravitational force) is also simulated between the Sun and the Earth, but the change in orbit is minimal (no change up to 7 significant digits).
